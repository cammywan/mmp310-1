##Setting up GitHub
Steps to set up a GitHub account and git repo for your classwork:
- Sign up for a GitHub account: [https://github.com/join?source=header-home](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
- Open the GitHub Desktop app and login using **GitHub Desktop > Preferences > Accounts**
- Create a repo with the `+` dropdown
- Set the repo folder to your MMP 210 classwork folder
- Type a message like "initial commit" and commit your project
- Click Publish
- Go to your GitHub account and look at your work
- Make some changes to your Week 2 assignment
- Look at changes in the GitHub Desktop app
- Commit and Publish!

**Adding a .gitignore file**
- On the root level of your projet, create a new document and save it as `.gitignore`
- For now this will have only one line:  

```
.DS_Store
```
- Commit the change and push the revision.

**README.md**
- README.md is a file that can be added to the git repo that will appear on your GitHub page and explain what the repo is for (these notes are an example of a README.md file ;)
- README.md uses Markdown, which is a special way of writing HTML
- [Here's a Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) but you won't be graded on Markdown
- Example README.md:

<pre><code>#MMP 210 Classwork
This is all of my classwork for MMP 210
- [Week 1](week1/)
- [Week 2](week2/)</code></pre>


*Next week we'll use GitHub Pages to see our work live online.*

**What is [git](https://git-scm.com/)?**
- git is a free, open source, distributed version control system (what??)
- It is used to save your work in multiple stages as you work on it so that you can easily recover and compare changes.
- It's great for collaboration, but we're mostly using it as a publishing tool.
