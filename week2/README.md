##Setting up GitHub
Steps to set up a GitHub account and git repo for your classwork:
- Sign up for a GitHub account: [https://github.com/join?source=header-home](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
- Open the GitHub Desktop app and login using **GitHub Desktop > Preferences > Accounts**
- Create a repo with the `+` dropdown
- Set the repo folder to your MMP 210 classwork folder
- Type a message like "initial commit" and commit your project
- Click Publish
- Go to your GitHub account and look at your work
- Make some changes to your Week 2 assignment
- Look at changes in the GitHub Desktop app
- Commit and Publish!

*Next week we'll use GitHub Pages to see our work live online.*

**What is [git](https://git-scm.com/)?**
- git is a free, open source, distributed version control system (what??)
- It is used to save your work in multiple stages as you work on it so that you can easily recover and compare changes.
- It's great for collaboration, but we're mostly using it as a publishing tool.
