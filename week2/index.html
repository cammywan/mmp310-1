Today we are going to look at some basic concepts in JavaScript and computer science in general which will allow us to interact with the browser and begin making dynamic designs. When we talk about dynamic design we mean making a design which changes given various inputs and interactions. The power of writing code is that we can build designs that react and change to various input, whether it is time, user interaction, data or other sources.</p>
