			<h1>JavaScript Input and Variables</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<p>JavaScript is a scripting language, a lightweight programming language, specifically designed for programming the elements of web pages. Today we are going to look at some basic concepts in JavaScript and computer science in general which will allow us to interact with the browser and begin making dynamic designs. When we talk about dynamic design we mean making a design which changes given various inputs and interactions. The power of writing code is that we can build designs that react and change to various input, whether it is time, user interaction, data or other sources.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<p>Let's go ahead and open the JavaScript console (in Google Chrome).</p>
			<div class="key">CAj</div>
			<p>We're going to add a series of commands and see what happens.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<p>Start by typing into the console.</p>
			<p><code><hb>></hb> document</code></p>
			<p>Look familiar?  This is our HTML document, interpreted as a node structure by the Document Object Model.</p>
		</div>

		<!--  writing stuff to dom / what is the dom? -->
		<div class="slide">
			<p>Quick aside: What is the document object model?</p>
			<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model" target="blank">DOM</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Examples" target="blank">DOM Examples</a></li>
			<p>We'll cover DOM in detail in another class.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>Okay, let's try a couple more lines: </p>
			<p><pre><hb>></hb> document.body
<hb>></hb> document.body.style
<hb>></hb> document.body.style.color = "purple";</pre></p>
			<p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>Try this:</p> 
			<pre><hb>></hb> document.write("Hello world!");</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<p>Oops!</p>
			<p>We could write our entire HTML document this way, but its easier to write some HTML and then modify it with JavaScript.</p>
			<pre><hb>></hb> var elem = document.createElement("h1");
<hb>></hb> elem.innerHTML = "JavaScript is kewl!";
<hb>></hb> document.body.appendChild(elem);</code></pre>
		</div>

		<!--  variables, how js treats numbers, strings booleans -->
		<div class="slide">
			<p>But wait, what is that <code>var</code> thing, and what are those functions??</p>
			<p>In Javascript, every variable is declared as <code>var</code> regardless of what type of information it holds.  Soon we will discuss datatypes as they relate to JavaScript.  JavaScript only works with a few basic variable types: numbers, strings and booleans, along with arrays and objects and functions, which can all be declared with <code>var</code>. </p>
			<p>Variables in JavaScript are more easily converted into each other.  This is called type coercion and we'll talk about that more next week as well.</p>
			<p>For now, let's write some variables and then keep going.</p>
			<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var" target="blank">var on MDN</a></p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<pre>> var x</pre>
(Oh, also, semicolons are "optional in JavaScript", but it's usually better to use them.)
<pre><hb>></hb> x = 10;
<hb>></hb> x++;
<hb>></hb> x;
<hb>></hb> x += 10;
<hb>></hb> x = x + 10;
<hb>></hb> x = "ten";
<hb>></hb> x = "10";
<hb>></hb> x++;
<hb>></hb> x = false;
<hb>></hb> typeof x;</pre>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>Okay, that was weird...</p>
			<p>But actually, very useful in someways and of course easy to write!</p>
			<p>Tricky, but useful...</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>Anyway, let's do something useful with that variable.</p>
			<p>With JavaScript, we can take inputs from the user and use them to modify our website or program in ways that we can't do with just HTML and CSS.</p>
			<p>Let's look at some JavaScript inputs.</p>
		</div>


		<!-- 
		button
		textarea
		input
			text
			select, option
			
		form
		 -->

		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Button</h2>
			<p>Button may the simplest form element:</p>
			<pre>&lt;button id="sumbit"&gt;Click me.&lt;/button&gt;</pre>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>There are a lot of ways we can writes scripts to detect when the button is clicked.  This is a type of event, and we'll talk more in depth about events next week.  For now, let's write a very simple <code>event handler</code> to tell our program the button is clicked.</p>
			<pre>var submit = document.getElementById("submit");
submit.onclick = function() {
	console.log(this);
};</pre>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<h2>console.log</h2>
			<p><code>console.log()</code> is a special JavaScript function that can be used to report things that are happening in the program to the developer console.  Like all languages, we need a way to print things to the console to see what works and doesn't it.  It's extremely useful and easy to use, but you have to remember to be specific.  You can put pretty much anything in the argument parentheses for <code>console.log()</code>, so make sure it's something useful, like an element, a variable, or something else that you want to be able to read.  This is a good way to read data from various events.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>What's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this" target="blank">this</a>?</p>
			<p>In JavaScript <code>this</code> is a little complicated, but for now, it's important to understand that <code>this</code> can be used in a function to sort of tell us what that function is.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Input</h2>
			<p>There are many different types of <code>input</code>.  Today we'll just use a text input:</p>
			<pre>&lt;input id="name" type="text" placeholder="Input name" /&gt;
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>We can use JavaScript to grad the value the user types in:</p>
			<pre>submit.onclick = function() {
	var name = document.getElementById("name").value;
};</pre>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>A <code>textarea</code> is a resizable <code>input</code> for text.</p>
			<pre>&lt;textarea id="email" placeholder="Input email" /&gt;</pre>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>A <code>select</code> element creates a dropdown input using the <code>option</code> element.</p>
			<pre>&lt;select id="borough"&gt;
	&lt;option&gt;Bronx&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;option&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;option&gt;Manhattan&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;option&gt;Queens&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;option&gt;Staten Island&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;</pre>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>Traditionally, we can place all of these elements into a <code>form</code> element, but we are not using any database or remote requests at this point, so we'll just use the elements and JavaScript to interact with them:</p>
			<pre>submit.onclick = function() {
	var name = document.getElementById("name").value;
	var email = document.getElementById("email").value;
	var borough = document.getElementById("borough").value;
	console.log(name, email, test);
	var message = document.getElementById("message");
	message.innerHTML = "Hello " + name + " from 
	 + borough + ", welcome to my website.";
};</pre>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Assignment 2: JavaScript input</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Use HTML inputs to get user information</li>
				<li>Save that information using JavaScript</li>
				<li>Present the user with some a response using some of their information</li>
