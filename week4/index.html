			<h1>JavaScript functions</h1>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/owenroberts/mmp310">MMP 310</a> > <a href="https://github.com/owenroberts/mmp310/tree/master/week3">Week 3</a></p>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>Functions are blocks of code that can be called repeatedly.  Functions are defined like variables but have parentheses following the function name.  Arguments can be placed inside the parathensis.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>Two function declarations:</p>
			<pre><code>function myFunction() {
	alert("Hello :)");
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>var myFunction = function() {
	alert("world");
};</code></pre>
			<p>I tend to prefer <em>named</em> functions like the second example, but both are valid.</p>
			<p>Notice how nothing happens after we declare the function.  The function is defined, but the code won't run until it is called:</p>
			<pre><code>myFunction();</code></pre>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>The function in the previous example isn't very useful.  We can just as easily write out <code>alert("world");</code> as we can <code>myFunction()</code>.  Even if there were more lines, if they only do one thing, it's not that useful.  What makes functions useful and modular is arguments.  We can use arguments to change the output of a function.</p>
			<p>Think of a function like a machine that has a series of actions.  For example, a car can drive from one place to another, as many times as you want it to.  But that's not very useful if there's no one in the car.  You can put anyone you want to in a car and take them wherever you want.  If we think of a car as a function it has many possible inputs: people, an origin and destination, the amount of gas, speed, radio channel, etc.  And these input have a result.  People are carried from one place to another.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>Let's write a function with arguments.</p>
			<pre><code>var greet = function(name, greeting) {
	var text = greeting + ", " + name;
	alert(text);
};
greet("Jenny", "Hello");
greet("Jerry", "Hi");</code></pre>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>Functions can also <code>return</code> values:</p>
			<pre><code>var add = function(n1, n2) {
	return n1 + n2;
};
var x = add(2, 2);
var y = add(x, 2);
var z = add(x, y);
console.log(add(x, y, z));</code></pre>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Anonymous functions</h2>
			<p>Regular JavaScript functions need to be called after they are declared.  There are cases where we want a function to run immediately. These are anonymous functions, which self execute:</p>
			<pre><code>(function() {
	var x = "Hello world";
	alert(x);
})();</code></pre>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p><span class="note">A quick note on scope:</span> We'll talk about scope in more detail later in the semester, but at this point it's important to realize that variables declared within a function are not available to other functions in our program.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>Bad scope example:</p>
			<pre><code>var assign = function() {
	var x = 0;
	var y = 1;
};
var add = function() {
	return x + y;
};
foo();
bar();</code></pre>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>Better scope example:</p>
			<pre><code>var x; 
var y;
var assign = function() {
	x = 0;
	y = 1;
};
var add = function() {
	return x + y;
};
foo();
bar();</code></pre>
